# Tip-Calculator
I am currently learning to develop iOS applications, and this is a simple tip calculator.

User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

Here is a GIF walkthrough of the Aplication:

Issues:
1st. I continued to get a a SIGABRT error everytime the settings button but I realized i didnt have a navigation controller.
2nd. I was having trouble during creating the settings page using NSuser defauts. I learned that I had to evaluate what would happen when a certain percentage was pressed on the settings page.
